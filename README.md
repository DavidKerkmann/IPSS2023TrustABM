Infodemics Pandemics Summer School 2023 Agent-based model to simulate pandemics with included trust system

This Agent-Based Modell was formulated at the Infodemics Pandemics Summer School 2023 in LÃ¼beck from Group 3 consisting of David Kerkmann, Sascha Korf, Wan Naszeerah and Marwa Suraj.

This agent based model focuses how agents are affected by different trusts in "Trust institutions" and how they act accordingly. For a first exmaple this is getting vaccinated.
This is all located in the main python file and a general overview is available with the Final Presentation File.
